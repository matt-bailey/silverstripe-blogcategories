**This is a fork of https://github.com/IOTI/silverstripe-blogcategories.git - I've added a composer.json file for [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) compatibility.**

silverstripe-blogcategories
===========================

This module adds a manageable list of categories to the SilverStripe blog Module.

Extract the files and put them the root of your SilverStripe install (or use Composer - see above).

It requires [SilverStripe v3.0.2+](http://www.silverstripe.org/) and the [SilverStripe Blog Module](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-blog) to be installed.
